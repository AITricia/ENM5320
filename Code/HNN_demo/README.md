This demo demonstrates an implementation of a Hamiltonian neural network to fit structure-preserving dynamics to observed trajectories of a double pendulum.

The folder consists of two files:
- A [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/natrask/ENM5320/blob/main/Code/HNN_demo/HNNsolver.ipynb) which generates data, trains a model to fit it, and visualizes the learned dynamics
- A saved checkpoint which can be loaded to facilitate transfer learning
